\subsection{Discharge}
Observed data for discharge were obtained from USGS in late September.

\subsubsection{Iterative calibration notes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Calibrated monthly flows by allowing basin snow parameters to vary across their full range. Iterated 2000 times. Used PBIAS to select best fit.
\end{itemize}

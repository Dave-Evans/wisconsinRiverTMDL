\subsection{Groundwater Inflow (Baseflow)}
	The SWAT parameter ALPHA\_BF controls the proportion baseflow to each subbasin reach. In order to regionalize (get a more local value for) this parameter, we retrieved daily stream flow data from the USGS \href{NWIS}{http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/dv} site. We selected all streams in Wisconsin larger than 19.3 $m^3$ and smaller than 386 $m^3$. This was done following WHO? Sites were also filtered so that they had at least a minimum of one year of contiguous flow data.

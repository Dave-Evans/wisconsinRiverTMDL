\subsubsection{Rotation Randomization}
%	We will want to note here that we discovered a systemic bias in alfalfa yield due to this randomization approach. AAAACC, AACCAA, and CCAAAA on average result harvest numbers of 46464, so yields are 50\% higher every other year. We decided that this is not an issue because we calibrated yields using an average across years. Also, it should not affect sediment or phosphorus export because alfalfa was never killed when harvested until final harvest.

\subsubsection{Reservoir Outflow}

The Wisconsin River basin is a highly managed system with many reservoirs and hydroelectric dams. To calibrate the water budget of the SWAT model, we forced flow to match observed flow at impoundments where flow is measured. We assume that if flow is not measured, then the impoundment outfall flows with the run of the river. We forced flow to observed at the sites of 24 impoundments, see table \ref{tab:res_table}.

Reservoir geometries were taken from the WDNR Statewide Dam Database\footnote{\url{http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Dams/documents/StatewideDamData.zip}}. Principal volumes, emergency volumes, principal surface areas, and dam locations (Table \ref{table:res_table}) were taken from the columns MAX\_STORAGE\_ACFT\_AMT, NORM_STORAGE_ACFT_AMT, IMPOUND\_AC\_AMT, and LL\_LAT\_DD\_AMT and LL\_LAT\_DD\_AMT, respectively. No estimates of emergency surface area exists for all reservoirs; it was therefore assumed that emergency surface area is 50\% greater than principal surface area.

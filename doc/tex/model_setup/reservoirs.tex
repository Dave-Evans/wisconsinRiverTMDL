\subsubsection{Reservoir Outflow}
The Wisconsin River basin is a highly managed system with many reservoirs and hydroelectric dams. To calibrate the water budget of the SWAT model, we forced flow to match observed flow at impoundments where flow is measured. We assume that if flow is not measured, then the impoundment outfall flows with the run of the river. We forced flow to observed at the sites of 24 impoundments, see table \ref{tab:res_table}.

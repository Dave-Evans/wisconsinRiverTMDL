Within each map unit are varying numbers of components with varying horizon depths (e.g., Ap and O1 are the surface horizons for Antigo and Houghton respectively. Components were aggregated to map units by averaging soil properties (e.g., percent sand) horizontally across horizons.}

The letter above each plot denotes hydrologic soil group (HSG). Each color represents a cluster of map units. The Z score for each soil property is reported as $Z = X - \mu / \sigma$ where $X$ is the value of the soil property, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the population mean and standard deviation of a soil property. Outliers were excluded. The x-axis shows soil properties where tot\_depth is the soil depth, sand/silt/clay are the percent composition of each texture class, bd is bulk density, k is saturated conductivity, awc is available water capacity, cbn is organic carbon concentration, and usle\_k is soil erodibility.}
